# docs/

Index of the top-level documentation. One line per file; specs that live
with their crate are indexed in [specs.md](specs.md). Subdirectories:
[adr/](adr/) (architecture decision records), [audits/](audits/) (review
reports), [diagnoses/](diagnoses/) (root-cause write-ups),
[ffn/](ffn/README.md) (FFN backend docs — weight, sparse, walk,
distributed).
