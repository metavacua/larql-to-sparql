//! Qwen architecture (Qwen 2, 2.5, 3, MoE variants).
//!
//! Mostly Llama-compatible but with these differences:
//! - Qwen2/2.5: attention Q/K/V bias terms
//! - Qwen3: QK norms (no bias), optional MoE FFN
//! - Qwen3 MoE: router at `mlp.gate.weight`, per-expert `mlp.experts.{E}.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight`

/// Qwen3.8 is the evidence: its `input_layernorm` weight has norm 3.83,
/// and HF's normed output has norm 75.5 — only reachable through
