//! Architecture registry — declarative metadata for every `model_type`
//! [`super::detect_from_json`] recognises.
//!
//! This is descriptive data alongside `detect_from_json`'s dispatch,
//! not a replacement for it — rewriting that `match` to be table-driven
//! would be a much bigger, riskier change for comparatively little
//! extra safety. Instead, [`tests::registry_entries_are_honored_by_detect_from_json`]
//! exercises every pattern this module declares against the real
//! dispatch, so a registry entry that stops matching (e.g. someone
//! reorders or narrows a `match` arm) fails CI. That test does **not**
//! catch the reverse — a new `match` arm added without a matching
//! registry entry — so a registry entry is still something to remember
//! when adding an architecture, the same as adding the `mod` in
//! `architectures/mod.rs`.
//!
//! The consumer this exists for: Vindex Factory's PR-time architecture
//! gate (docs/vindex-factory.md §15.2) — "does the pinned larql release
//! understand this `model_type`, and if so what does it support" —
//! answerable without loading a model.
//!
//! One file per concept: [`pattern`] (how a string is matched),
//! [`attention`] (attention-family vocabulary), [`entry`] (one row's
//! shape), [`table`] (the data itself).
