//! Architecture inventory of an HF checkpoint directory (`larql inspect-hf`).
//!
//! The first rung of the vindex3 container programme (G0): before a single
//! byte is converted, produce a machine-readable statement of **what the
//! checkpoint declares** next to **what this build would do with it** —
//! identity, components, per-layer attention policy, tensor objects, and,
//! centrally, every `config.json` key the config parser does *not* read.
//!
//! An unconsumed key is a serving bug in waiting: the parser's silence means
//! some default will answer for it on every forward pass (see
//! `docs/k3-funnel.md` §4.7.8 — rope_scaling, layer_types, rms_norm_eps and
//! attention biases have each already shipped that failure). The inventory
//! makes the gap visible from the config alone, with no forward pass and no
//! reference implementation.
//!
//! Downstream (G1), a planner consumes this inventory and reports what the
//! vindex3 container schema can and cannot represent — so representation
//! gaps surface as design findings before any conversion work starts.
