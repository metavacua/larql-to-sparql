//! Output types for the architecture inventory — the JSON `larql inspect-hf`
//! emits.
//!
//! Two deliberately separate sections carry the same subject matter from two
//! authorities:
//!
//! - **`config_keys`** — what the checkpoint *declares*, verbatim, with a
//!   per-key statement of whether this build's config parser reads it.
//! - **`resolved`** — what this build's detection *does* with it: the
//!   per-layer policy table the serving path would actually run.
//!
//! Disagreement between the two sections is the instrument's whole point.
//! A config fact the parser never reads (`status: unconsumed`) is the
//! [§4.7.8] failure shape *before* it ships: a field with one behavioural
//! default silently answering for every family. Five distinct serving bugs
//! have had that shape; this report makes the sixth visible from
//! `config.json` alone, with no forward pass.
//!
//! [§4.7.8]: ../../../../docs/k3-funnel.md
