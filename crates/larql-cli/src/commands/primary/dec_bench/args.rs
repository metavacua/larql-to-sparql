//! Clap args for `larql dec-bench` — the DEC residual-replay loadgen
//! (docs/dec-funnel.md §3, DEC-0). Two sub-modes:
//!
//!   * `capture` — run single-stream decode over N prompts against a live
//!     expert server, recording each step's pre-normed per-layer residuals
//!     into a portable pool.
//!   * `replay`  — sweep batch × wire × dispatch against the server using
//!     B-row frames built from the pool; emit the `dec/*` schema.
