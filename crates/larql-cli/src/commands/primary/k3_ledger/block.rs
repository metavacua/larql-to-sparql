//! DEC-9.2 — speculative block economics, with work-width separated from
//! commit-width (R5) and logical reuse separated from physical (R6).
//!
//! Pure. This module's pre-registration was withdrawn twice, both times before
//! any compute was spent, and both times for an arithmetic error over correct
//! measurements. The types here exist so neither can recur silently:
//!
//!   v1 scaled DEC-8.7a's routed-*zeroed* ceiling by block length, deleting the
//!      routed term from the one setting where it returns and grows.
//!   v2 used one variable as both union index and amortisation divisor, which
//!      silently assumes perfect acceptance.
//!
//! The honest condition is
//!
//! ```text
//!   D*d(T) + rho_r*R*r(T) + S(T)  <=  eta * B_target * A(T)
//! ```
//!
//! with `T` (positions evaluated), `A(T)` (positions committed), `u(T)` (logical
//! union) and `d(T)`/`r(T)` (physical bytes actually read) all independent.
