//! The premises a `frontier` row is conditional on, made explicit and printable.
//!
//! Pure. This file exists because of a specific misquote: the frontier's
//! "8 tok/s needs ~3.8 payload bits" row was read beside the composed exact
//! ceiling of 5.77 tok/s as though the two answered the same question.
//!
//! They do not, and the difference is not a detail:
//!
//! | | `frontier` | `ceilings` |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | question | given a credited routed reduction, what must the **dense path** reach? | what does the **whole model** cost as configured? |
//! | routed bytes | credited a retention (default: the banked up-fold, 2/3) | priced in full at their format |
//! | efficiency | **one scalar**, defaulting to **1.00 — ideal** | **per-class measured** eta, 0.64-0.89 |
//! | output | a *requirement* on dense precision | a *ceiling* in tok/s |
//!
//! So a frontier row is a target generator: it says what would have to be true.
//! A ceilings row is a ledger: it says what is true given the formats. Quoting
//! the first as if it were the second credits a routed reduction that has not
//! been measured and an efficiency of 1.00 that no kernel reaches.
//!
//! Every warning below names a premise that, left unstated, would let a row
//! travel further than its evidence.
