//! The routed-bank override: expert bytes sourced from a VINDEX3 container.
//!
//! # What this closes
//!
//! Every VINDEX3 execution result before this one bound its operands out of a
//! **VINDEX2** file. `moe_bound` says so plainly, and the container ladder
//! (c8/c9) proved only that the same bytes could be *written* to a VINDEX3
//! container — not that anything would ever *read* one to compute with. That
//! left a gap nothing on the execution path could cross: `Vindex3Container`
//! appeared nowhere in this crate.
//!
//! ```text
//! before   VINDEX2 index ──> MoeLayerWeights ──> bound executor
//! now      VINDEX3 container ──> expert regions ─┘
//!                                (everything else still VINDEX2)
//! ```
//!
//! # Exactly one operand source is replaced
//!
//! The spine — tokenizer, config, embeddings, attention, norms, routers,
//! shared/dense FFN, LM head — is read from the VINDEX2 model, unchanged and
//! byte-for-byte. Only classes 4 and 5 (routed gate/up and routed down, spec
//! §4) come from the container. That is what makes a comparison against a
//! plain VINDEX2 run a statement about *the routed bytes* and nothing else: if
//! this route substituted anything further, a divergence would have somewhere
//! else to hide.
//!
//! This is also the K3 deployment topology in miniature — a small resident
//! spine plus huge paged routed banks — but it is **not** artifact identity. A
//! composed run is two directories, and a VINDEX3 model that still needs a
//! VINDEX2 directory to run is not yet a model. Container completeness (the
//! `control/`, `dense/`, `shared/` and sidecar classes of spec §5) is a
//! separate job and this type does not pretend to stand in for it.
//!
//! # Public API only, deliberately
//!
//! Regions are reached through `Vindex3Container -> segment -> region_bytes`
//! and never by parsing LYRW descriptors here. The binary layout is mid-change
//! (24 B → 28 B bank descriptors with an explicit `group_width`); a backend
//! that read the descriptor itself would have to be rewritten alongside it,
//! and would have been a second implementation of the reader in the meantime.
//!
//! # No fallback, ever
//!
//! If a layer, an expert or a role is missing, this refuses. It does not quietly
//! serve the VINDEX2 bytes that are sitting right there in the same process —
//! doing so would make "the model ran from VINDEX3" unfalsifiable, which is the
//! only claim the route exists to support.
