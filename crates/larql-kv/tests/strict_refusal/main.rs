//! The strict guarantee, end to end: a refused expert cannot become a token.
//!
//! The `FfnBackend` ring gave the refusal a typed channel. The dispatch ring
//! widened the six `kv_*_via_dispatch` helpers so it survives the per-layer
//! loop, and `StandardEngine` terminates it as `EngineError::Execution`. These
//! tests drive the whole chain from the engine's public surface, because that
//! is the only altitude at which the guarantee is observable — every
//! intermediate ring can be correct while the composition still erases.
//!
//! ## What is pinned
//!
//! ```text
//! strict       + refusing route  → Err, original RefusalKind, no hidden state
//! best-effort  + refusing route  → Ok, complete dense half, refusal recorded
//! not applicable                 → Ok, local dispatch, nothing recorded
//! ```
//!
//! The first is the merge gate ([`gate`]). [`outcomes`] holds the other two,
//! and the question strict semantics raise that the old silent path did not:
//! what a refusal leaves behind. "Fix the residency and retry" is only a
//! supported workflow if a refused step mutated nothing — so a decode either
//! rewinds what it appended, or says it could not and refuses to continue.
//!
//! Those two sweep `StandardEngine`. The other axis is the engine itself:
//! [`engines`] runs the gate against every `EngineKind`, and [`engine_state`]
//! runs the outcome questions against each one — because the rewind-or-
//! invalidate answer differs by what each engine treats as canonical.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! `prefill_quant` / `decode_step_quant` are deliberately absent: by contract
//! they discard the caller's FFN and substitute a `WalkFfn` built from the
//! vindex, so a strict route cannot reach the dispatch ring through them. The
//! resident pair is the production strict path — it threads the caller's FFN
//! through the same `do_prefill` / `do_decode_step` bodies — and is covered.
//!
//! The engines that route their FFN through `larql_kv::engines::layer_ffn_or_moe`
//! rather than through the dispatch helpers (markov-rs, markov-rs-codec,
//! turbo-quant, unlimited-context, boundary-per-layer) are covered by
//! [`engines_gate`] and [`engine_state`]: that helper carries the refusal too
//! now. So does `larql_kv::generation::kv_prefill_run`, which is both
//! `no-cache`'s forward and the oracle the dispatch ring is compared against.
//!
//! `apollo` is the one engine that cannot dispatch experts at all — its
//! forward runs below the `FfnBackend` seam — so it refuses the
//! *architecture* rather than a route. See [`engines`]'s header.
