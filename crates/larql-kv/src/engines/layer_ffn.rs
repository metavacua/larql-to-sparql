/// falls through to the dense path, which is exactly what it did before.
/// Conflating that with a refusal is what the typed channel exists to prevent.
///
/// Whether an `Err` can arrive at all is the *policy*'s decision, not the
/// route's: `MoeFfn::best_effort` records the refusal and returns the dense
/// half, so a shard outage still degrades rather than stopping. Only
/// `MoeFfn::strict` converts it into an error here.
///
/// Before this returned a `Result`, a refusal was printed to stderr and the
