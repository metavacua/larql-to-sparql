//! Prompt sets for accuracy testing.
//!
//! 100 diverse prompts spanning: factual, completion, reasoning,
//! code, arithmetic, scientific, geographic, conversational.
//!
//! Every prompt is tagged with a [`KnowledgeSource`] — `Parametric` for
//! the corpus here (knowledge that lives in the model's weights and is
//! recoverable from a short cue) vs. `InContext` for needle-style
//! corpora that plant a fact in the prompt itself (see
//! [`super::needle`]) and `Conflict` for prompts where the in-context
//! claim contradicts pretraining (see [`super::conflict`]).
//!
//! For KV-cache compression engines, the distinction matters: parametric
//! knowledge survives any K/V strategy (it's in the weights), while
//! in-context knowledge is exactly what's at risk under sliding-window,
//! residual-stream-replacement, quantised K/V, or boundary checkpoints.
//! Reporting one number without splitting hides whichever signal you
//! care about.
