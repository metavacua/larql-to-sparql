//! Tests for [`super`] — the `MTLResidencySet` arms.
//!
//! This module is a **retained instrument for a refuted hypothesis**: the
//! A/B/C ladder it exists to run showed explicit residency buys nothing
//! (19.61 / 19.63 / 19.80 ms/token), so nothing here should be read as
//! claiming otherwise. What the tests pin is the part that still matters —
//! that the instrument reports its own engagement honestly, because the
//! null result is only trustworthy if the arm actually attached. A
//! silently-inactive residency set and a residency set that does nothing
//! produce the same timing and must not be confused.
//!
//! The Objective-C calls themselves are not asserted against Metal's
//! internal state (there is no public way to read a set's allocations
//! back); what is asserted is that every one of them is reachable, that
//! the lifecycle flags track the calls, and that the whole thing degrades
//! to `None` rather than panicking on a runtime without the class.
