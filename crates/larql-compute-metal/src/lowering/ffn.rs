//! Lowering a plan's gated FFN into one encoder (VINDEX3-G6b).
//!
//! The first fragment of a `LayerOpPlan` to be lowered, chosen because it
//! is self-contained — norm in, hidden-sized vector out, no KV cache and
//! no position policy — and because it is roughly three quarters of
//! Glimmer's weight bytes.
//!
//! Deliberately literal. Every operation the plan states gets its own
//! encoder action, in plan order:
//!
//! ```text
//! h ─ pre_ffn_norm ─┬─ gate proj ─┐
//!                   └─ up proj ───┴─ SiLU-GLU ─ down proj ─ post_ffn_norm ─ residual ─ h'
//! ```
//!
//! The post-FFN norm is present only under four-norm placement, and it
//! normalises the **branch output before** the residual add — not the
//! summed hidden state after it.
//!
//! No fusion yet. A fused activation+down kernel exists for Q4_K/Q6_K and
//! would be faster, but it would also make the correspondence between the
//! plan and the encoded work harder to check, and this rung's job is to
//! establish that correspondence. Fusion is a later, separately-judged
//! change.
//!
//! `stages::ffn::encode_gated` is not reused: it dispatches on
//! `larql_compute::QuantFormat`, which has no NVFP4 variant, so routing a
//! plan through it would mean either lying about the format or extending
//! the serving path's enum for a format it does not serve.
