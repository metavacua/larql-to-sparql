//! Lowering a whole decoder stack into one scheduling domain (G6c-1).
//!
//! G6b closed one layer. This composes N of them with the hidden state
//! and every layer's KV **resident on the device**, so the host is not in
//! the dependency chain at any point between the first upload and the
//! final readback.
//!
//! That is the entire point of the rung. The interpreter path commits and
//! waits 209 times per Glimmer token, and the measured cost of doing so
//! is queue starvation: ~215-271 us of empty queue before each dispatch,
//! flat in bytes, collapsing to ~57 us at queue depth 32. Here the queue
//! never drains, because nothing needs the host's answer.
//!
//! ## Two structural invariants
//!
//! ```text
//! no wait_until_completed() inside the layer loop
//! no readback / contents() inside the layer loop
//! ```
//!
//! Both are enforced by construction rather than by discipline:
//! [`MetalBackend::encode_stack`] takes an encoder it does not own and
//! returns nothing, so it *cannot* wait or read. The caller commits once,
//! after the whole stack is encoded.
//!
//! ## Per-layer policy is static
//!
//! Muse-Glimmer's 52 layers are 39 sliding(2048)+RoPE and 13 full+NoPE in
//! a 3:1 pattern. Every one of those differences is known before
//! execution begins — they come from the plan, not from anything the
//! stack computes — so encoding them costs no round trip. Note that in
//! *this* model span and position happen to be perfectly correlated
//! (sliding↔RoPE, full↔NoPE); they are independent fields and a caller
//! may combine them freely.
//!
//! ## Checkpoints
//!
//! Localising a divergence inside a 52-layer stream would normally mean
//! reintroducing the readbacks this rung removes. Instead a caller names
//! layers whose output should be *copied to its own device buffer*; all
//! of them are read after the single scheduling domain completes.
