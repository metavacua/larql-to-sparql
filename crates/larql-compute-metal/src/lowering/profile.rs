//! Per-stage GPU attribution for a lowered token.
//!
//! The lowered token is one command buffer of serially dependent kernels,
//! and its cost splits into bytes moved (the bandwidth floor) and a
//! residual. On every container measured 2026-08-19 that residual is
//! roughly constant across representations — ~10 ms on Gemma 4 26B-A4B
//! whether attention is f16 or NVFP4, ~8 ms on gpt-oss — which is the
//! signature of per-kernel fixed cost rather than bytes. Closing it needs
//! to know *which* kernels carry it, and this GPU only exposes timestamps
//! at **stage (encoder) boundaries**: `MTLCounterSamplingPointAtDispatchBoundary`
//! is unsupported on Apple silicon (`examples/counter_probe.rs`).
//!
//! So the lowering encodes through a [`StageEncoders`] seam instead of a
//! bare encoder. Production hands in [`SingleEncoder`] — one encoder for
//! the whole token, `stage()` is a label and nothing else, scheduling
//! unchanged. Profiling hands in [`StageProfiler`], which opens a fresh
//! sampled encoder each time the stage changes and resolves the GPU
//! timestamps after completion.
//!
//! ## What the numbers mean
//!
//! - Encoder boundaries themselves are free (`examples/lowered_dispatch_floor.rs`:
//!   one encoder per dependent dispatch runs *no slower* than one encoder
//!   for all of them). Sampling is not: each sampled boundary drains the
//!   pipeline and costs ~15 us (`examples/counter_stage_probe.rs`). The
//!   report therefore carries its own distortion — the profiled token's
//!   GPU span against the unprofiled one — and a stage's span is an
//!   upper bound inflated by at most a few microseconds of drain.
//! - Units are nanoseconds: the sum of samples reproduces
//!   `GPUEndTime - GPUStartTime` (the probe checks this).
