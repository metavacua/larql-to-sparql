//! Execution-path witness counters — part of rung E's CONTRACT, not a
//! temporary diagnostic.
//!
//! The poison proof shows layer output does not DEPEND on host-visible
//! route values; these counters prove the route-dependent host work is
//! genuinely ABSENT — because F's performance claim needs the work gone,
//! not merely output-irrelevant, and because a later refactor could
//! quietly reintroduce a host dependency while preserving numerical
//! parity. The legacy CPU-routed path bumps them at every
//! route-dependent host action; the descriptor path must leave them
//! untouched. Gates assert a zero delta across the candidate encode and
//! a non-zero delta across the control encode (the witness's own
//! positive control).
//!
//! Process-wide relaxed atomics: encode paths are already serialized per
//! backend, and the gates only compare deltas taken on one thread.
