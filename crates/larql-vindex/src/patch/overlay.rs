/// A vindex with patches applied as an overlay.
/// The base **files on disk** are never modified.
///
/// ## Layering: gate overrides vs down vector overrides
///
/// `PatchedVindex` deliberately stores its overrides in **two different
/// places** depending on what they are:
///
/// - **Gate vectors** (`insert_feature`, `update_feature_meta`) live in
///   `self.overrides_gate` and `self.overrides_meta` — true overlays
///   that don't touch the base. `gate_knn` consults these on top of the
///   base scores.
///
/// - **Down vectors** (`set_down_vector`) are forwarded to
///   `self.base.set_down_vector`, which mutates the base's
///   `down_overrides` HashMap in place. The base files on disk remain
///   unchanged, but the in-memory base picks up the override directly.
///   `walk_ffn`'s `down_override(layer, feat)` lookup then finds the
///   override on the base.
///
/// This asymmetry is **intentional** and load-bearing for
/// `COMPILE INTO VINDEX`. The dense FFN inference path
/// (`walk_ffn_full_mmap`) reads gate scores from `gate_vectors.bin` via
/// `gate_scores_batch`. If the inserted (norm-matched) gate vector were
/// baked into that file, the dense activation at the inserted slot
/// would become moderate-to-large; combined with the override down
/// vector (multi-layer constellation install at α=0.25 per layer) the
/// residual stream blows up. Keeping the source's weak free-slot gate
/// at the inserted index leaves the dense activation small, so
/// `small_activation × poseidon_vector` per layer accumulates into the
/// validated constellation effect.
///
/// `COMPILE INTO VINDEX` therefore:
///   - Hard-links `gate_vectors.bin` from source (unchanged), and
///   - Bakes the down vectors into `down_weights.bin` via column-rewrite
///     at the inserted slots.
///
/// This is why `down_overrides()` reaches through to the base while
/// `overrides_gate_at()` reads the patch overlay — the two types of
/// override live in different places by design. Don't "fix" this by
/// moving down vectors into a separate overlay map, or you'll have to
/// re-solve the activation-blowup problem.
