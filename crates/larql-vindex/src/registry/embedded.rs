//! The production VINDEX3 registry's actual data — `registry/index.json` +
//! `registry/models/*.json` at the repo root, baked into the binary at
//! compile time.
//!
//! # Why compile-time embed, not a runtime file read
//!
//! `docs/vindex3-registry-design.md` §7 left this open ("embedded? a
//! file? fetched?"). A runtime read relative to the process's working
//! directory or executable path only works from a source checkout —
//! release binaries (ADR-0026) ship standalone, with no repo nearby. A
//! remote fetch would make every `larql pull <registry-name>` depend on
//! a second service beyond HF, which §7 already ruled out ("no website,
//! no remote registry service"). `include_str!` matches the precedent
//! [`super::fixtures`] already set — "static, in-process, no network" —
//! while still sourcing from real, git-reviewed JSON files rather than a
//! Rust literal, so a registry change is an ordinary reviewable diff.
//!
//! The real consequence, accepted deliberately: a new or updated entry
//! reaches users only via a new binary release, not instantly on merge.
//! That is not a regression — "official status conferred by PR merge"
//! (the promotion design, `docs/vindex3-registry-publishing-design.md`)
//! was already going to require a release to actually ship the entry;
//! this just means the release, not the merge, is the activation point.
//!
//! # Why one embed per model, not a glob
//!
//! `include_str!` needs a compile-time literal path — it cannot walk
//! `registry/models/` at build time without a build script. R3A is
//! deliberately one entry (`docs/vindex3-registry-design.md`'s own
//! scoping note: prove the representation works before generalising
//! it). [`embedded_model_json`] is the one place a second entry's
//! `include_str!` line joins this match — a small, explicit list, not
//! speculative glob machinery for a count that has been one.
