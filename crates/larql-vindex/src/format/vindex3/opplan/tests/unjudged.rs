//! Absence stays absence: withdrawing a declaration must not reappear as
//! a plausible identity.
//!
//! Each control removes one declared fact from an otherwise-complete
//! four-norm fixture and asserts the plan reports the operation as
//! *absent* rather than as a multiply by one. The failure these guard
//! against is not a crash — it is an ingestion regression producing a
//! fully executable program that is quietly wrong, which no downstream
//! authority can detect because every authority agrees on the default.
