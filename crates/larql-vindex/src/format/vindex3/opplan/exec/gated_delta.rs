//! Reference Gated DeltaNet: the recurrence, written to be read.
//!
//! Deliberately slow and literal. No fused kernel, no vectorisation, no
//! reassociation — this exists so someone can put it beside
//! `torch_recurrent_gated_delta_rule` in `transformers` and compare it line
//! by line. Speed is QW-4's problem.
//!
//! The state is owned here, on purpose. A DeltaNet layer's continuation
//! state is one dense `Dk × Dv` matrix per value head and does not grow
//! with the sequence, so it is not a KV cache and must not be forced
//! through one. Whether the engine should have a single abstraction
//! covering both is a real question, and it is QW-3's — answering it before
//! the arithmetic is proven would risk baking a wrong recurrence into a
//! nice-looking generic interface.

// Explicit index loops on purpose. This module's stated job is to sit
// beside `torch_recurrent_gated_delta_rule` and be checkable line by line,
// and the reference indexes `[..., i]` over named axes. Iterator chains
// would read better in isolation and worse against the thing they must be
// verified against — and verification is the entire point of the file.
