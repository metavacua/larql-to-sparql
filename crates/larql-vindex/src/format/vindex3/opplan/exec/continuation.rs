//! What has to survive between decode steps.
//!
//! LARQL no longer has a KV-cache abstraction. It has a **continuation
//! state** abstraction, of which KV is one form. That is not a rename: a
//! hybrid checkpoint carries two genuinely different mechanisms at once,
//! and Qwen3.8-27B carries 48 of one and 16 of the other.
//!
//! ```text
//! softmax layer     grows a sequence-indexed K/V store
//! recurrent layer   carries a fixed-size matrix, constant in sequence length
//! ```
//!
//! # The division of labour
//!
//! Continuation geometry says **what must persist**. The operator says
//! **how it changes**. Nothing here knows what a Gated DeltaNet is, and
//! that is the point: the next consumer of [`RecurrentGeometry`] is Kimi's
//! KDA, a different update rule over the same kind of durable storage. If
//! this type had been shaped around DeltaNet's semantics, KDA would need a
//! second variant and the abstraction would have failed at its first real
//! test.
//!
//! # Why an enum rather than `Option<LayerKvGeometry>`
//!
//! `Option` would collapse four distinct facts into one `None`: no state at
//! all, recurrent state instead of KV, unknown, and unsupported. A planner
//! reading `None` could not tell "this layer needs nothing" from "this
//! layer needs something I cannot describe", and would size memory for both
//! identically.
