//! The CPU executor: LARQL owns the threads, kernels own the arithmetic.
//!
//! CPU-1B measured the hazard this module exists to remove. Accelerate's
//! `sgemv` arrives **already internally threaded** — partitioning rows on
//! top of it wins 1.14x and sometimes loses — while the fused BF16 kernel
//! starts serial and scales 3.56x to twelve workers. Two paths with
//! opposite threading needs, and a decode that mixes them.
//!
//! If each kernel grew its own Rayon parallelism, a stack running both
//! would oversubscribe: nested pools, 12 workers each spawning 12. So the
//! rule here is one sentence:
//!
//! > **At most one layer of parallelism owns the machine for a
//! > primitive.**
//!
//! A kernel therefore never calls `par_iter`. It exposes a ROW RANGE
//! primitive — "compute these output rows from this slab of weight" — and
//! the executor decides how many workers to use and how to cut the rows.
//! A kernel that wants no external threading says so
//! ([`CpuParallelism::LibraryOwned`]) and is called once.
