//! CPU-PERF-3B: replay a real token's projections against the real
//! resident model.
//!
//! The synthetic shape harness predicts real BF16 projection to +0.7% and
//! misses real Q8 by +7.9%. Machine state, allocation alignment and the
//! code/scale stream split have each been falsified, and one structural
//! difference is left:
//!
//! ```text
//!   harness   one 178 MB matrix, exercised in a tight loop
//!   decode    369 distinct operands over 27 GB, each touched once
//! ```
//!
//! This closes that gap by removing everything else. It records the
//! projections one steady step actually issued — the real resident
//! operands, the real geometry, the real activations, in the real order —
//! and replays exactly those, with no norm, no recurrence, no attention,
//! no activation function in between.
//!
//! ```text
//!   synthetic shape harness     ~326 ms
//!   this replay                    X
//!   full decode Projection      ~352 ms
//! ```
//!
//! `X` near 352 says the synthetic harness fails because it cannot
//! reproduce full-model residency. `X` near 326 says residency is
//! innocent and the cost comes from interleaving projections with the
//! rest of decode.
//!
//! **The ordering arms are diagnostic, not proposals.** Replaying the
//! same calls grouped by operand family, or shuffled, separates a
//! locality effect from a cost intrinsic to traversing hundreds of
//! distinct allocations.
