//! CPU-4X: what is int8 weight x int8 ACTIVATION actually worth?
//!
//! CPU-3A and CPU-4A between them established that this execution family
//! is conversion-bound: Q8 left the memory-bound regime at 83.6 GB/s
//! stored against bf16's 121.7, and Q4 — half the bytes again — came back
//! 20% SLOWER because it does strictly more unpacking per weight. Fewer
//! weight bits against f32 activations has stopped paying.
//!
//! The remaining lever is the arithmetic DOMAIN. `SDOT` multiplies int8
//! by int8 into an i32 accumulator in one instruction, so the widen chain
//! that Q8 spends its time on disappears entirely — but the activation
//! has to be quantised first, and that is a cost the f32 path does not
//! pay.
//!
//! **Mechanics only.** Nothing here claims the arithmetic is accurate
//! enough to use; that is a separate and larger numerical decision than
//! weight quantisation, and it gets its own rung with its own gates. The
//! question is narrower: is this a 1.2x idea or a 3x idea?
//!
//! Three costs are timed SEPARATELY, because they have different fixes. A
//! single total would hide whether the activation quantiser or the GEMV
//! is the problem:
//!
//! ```text
//!   quantise    f32 activation -> int8 + scale
//!   gemv        int8 x int8 -> i32, via SDOT
//!   rescale     i32 -> f32, one multiply per output row
//! ```
//!
//! ```text
//! QW_SDOT=1 cargo test --release exec::cpu::tests::sdot -- --nocapture
