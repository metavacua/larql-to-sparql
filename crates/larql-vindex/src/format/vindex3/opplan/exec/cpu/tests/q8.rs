//! CPU-3A: does a fused Q8 consumer beat the BF16 one, and does it

//!
//! Two separate questions, deliberately not mixed. Whether Q8 is a good
//! enough REPRESENTATION of a checkpoint is CPU-3B and needs logits, a
//! trajectory, continuation state and PARITY-FLOOR-1. Nothing here
//! touches that. Here the format is a given and the only claims are
//! mechanical: the kernel realises `code * scale` faithfully, and it is
//! or is not faster.
//!
//! The bench reports **time per matrix** rather than GB/s, because GB/s
//! is the metric that makes a good Q8 kernel look bad: half the bytes at
//! a lower rate is still less time, and a rate comparison would hide
//! that. Both byte rates are printed — stored bytes and the f32 the
//! weights DENOTE — so neither can be quoted without the other.
