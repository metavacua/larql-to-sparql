//! CPU-PERF-2: why does real Q8 x F32 drift when BF16 does not?
//!
//! CPU-PERF-1 found two things that want one explanation. The isolated
//! harness reproduces real BF16 projection to +0.7% and under-predicts
//! real Q8 by 7.9%; and across three quiet, warm, interleaved runs BF16
//! stays flat (453 / 459 / 449 ms) while Q8 climbs monotonically (379 /
//! 401 / 425).
//!
//! The hypothesis: **it is machine STATE, and only the conversion-bound
//! kernel can see it.** A real Q8 run quantises tens of GB at load and
//! then immediately runs a kernel whose limit is integer-to-float
//! conversion throughput. If core frequency is depressed even modestly,
//! that kernel slows nearly in proportion. BF16 sits at the ~120 GB/s
//! memory wall, where a lower clock changes very little.
//!
//! Three kernels now exist that occupy three regimes, which makes them
//! three thermometers rather than three benchmarks:
//!
//! ```text
//!   bf16 x f32     memory-bound       121.7 GB/s
//!   q8   x f32     conversion-bound    83.4 GB/s
//!   q8   x q8      memory-bound       118.0 GB/s   (SDOT)
//! ```
//!
//! and the signatures separate the candidates cleanly:
//!
//! ```text
//!   frequency / thermal   only q8 x f32 moves, and recovers when idle
//!   memory or system      all three move together
//!   neither               nothing moves here, and the problem is in
//!                         real execution integration rather than the
//!                         machine
//! ```
//!
//! No reboot first: a reboot would erase the state being explained.
//!
//! ```text
//! QW_REGIME=1 cargo test --release exec::cpu::tests::regime_stability -- --nocapture
