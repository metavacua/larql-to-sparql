//! What the executor ACTUALLY ran — the counterpart to what the loader
//! decided.
//!
//! The residency census reads the loader's own bookkeeping, so on its own
//! it cannot fail the way that matters: a census can report 51 GB compact
//! while every projection quietly widens a tile before computing. The two
//! instruments answer different questions and only agree if both are true.
//!
//! Global rather than per backend, for the reason the pool is:
//! `ProductionBackend` is a zero-sized value that call sites construct
//! freely, so per-instance counters would each see a fraction of a decode
//! and none of them the whole.
//!
//! Cost is two relaxed atomic adds per projection against roughly 400
//! projections and 51 GB of streaming per token — unmeasurable, so it is
//! always on rather than behind a feature that would be off exactly when
//! a number needed explaining.
