//! Caller-owned continuation state for the executor's traversals
//! (VI3-INF-2/3).
//!
//! [`DecodeSession`](super::decode::DecodeSession) used to own its K/V
//! rows as private per-layer `Vec<Vec<f32>>`. That was right for
//! proving decode semantics and wrong as the production
//! continuation-state architecture: the state a conversation carries
//! between steps is *policy* (residency, quantisation, windowing,
//! checkpointing), and policy composes outside the executor. This
//! module is the seam: the session drives a [`KvState`] provider and
//! owns none of the rows.
//!
//! The provider learns its geometry **from the plan** —
//! [`plan_kv_geometry`] reads each layer's KV row width and attention
//! window out of the executable program itself. No head-count
//! inference from a family registry, no `ModelArchitecture` questions:
//! sliding/full and head dims are explicit properties of the program.
//!
//! Contract notes:
//!
//! - Rows are stored exactly as the backend returned them (post-norm,
//!   post-rope) and returned position-ordered from position 0. A
//!   provider must hold **every** appended row — the span logic, not
//!   the store, excludes positions a window masks out (the cache may
//!   hold a position the span must exclude; dropping it is a policy
//!   the executor has not been taught to coordinate with).
//! - The `&[Vec<f32>]` row-slice shape mirrors
//!   [`AttentionStepCall`](super::backend::AttentionStepCall) and
//!   changes only with it; a flat or device-resident representation is
//!   a later rung tied to that backend contract.
