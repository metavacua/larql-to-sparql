//! The backend seam (V3-G5b-3b): what *executes* a plan, versus what the
//! plan *means*.
//!
//! One [`ComponentOpPlan`](super::super::ComponentOpPlan), one interpreter,
//! many backends. The interpreter in [`super`] owns every decision that is
//! semantics — operation ordering, residual ordering, layer traversal,
//! whether an optional operation exists at all, and how position and span
//! policy dispatch. A [`PlanBackend`] owns only the numerical realisation
//! of work it is handed.
//!
//! **Nothing in this file mentions a model family, and nothing in it takes
//! a plan type.** Backends receive primitives, judged enums, and *already
//! loaded* weight slices — never a `LayerPlan`, an `OperandRef`, or the
//! `OperandStore`. That is deliberate and load-bearing: a backend that
//! could resolve its own operands by name, or read the layer structure,
//! could quietly grow into a second implementation of the model and
//! disagree with the IR while still passing. It cannot reach the bytes,
//! so it cannot reinterpret them.
//!
//! The corollary for anyone adding a method: if a backend needs to ask
//! *whether* to do something, the seam is in the wrong place. It should
//! only ever be told what to compute.
