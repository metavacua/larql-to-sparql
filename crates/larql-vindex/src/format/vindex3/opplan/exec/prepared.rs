//! Operands lowered into the backend's execution form, once.
//!
//! A [`ComponentOpPlan`] names its operands; it does not hold them.
//! Turning those names into arithmetic-ready weights — widening,
//! re-quantising to the backend's declared format, and handing the
//! backend a chance to place them on a device — is the expensive step,
//! and it is *model-shaped*, not request-shaped.
//!
//! Before this module both traversals loaded operands as they went:
//! [`DecodeSession`](super::decode::DecodeSession) built its own set at
//! construction, and the batch traversal called `store.load(...)` per
//! layer (per *position*, for norms). A server that batch-prefills and
//! then decodes therefore materialised the whole model twice per
//! request — measured at 3.8 s + 3.3 s against 0.13 s of actual decode
//! on a 3 B container.
//!
//! [`PreparedOperands`] is that state made explicit. It is deliberately
//! *not* a cache inside the operand loader: residency is a fact about a
//! served model, and hiding it behind a memoised loader would leave
//! device placement, accounting, and slicing with nowhere to live.
//!
//! # Composition with the operand seam
//!
//! Preparation resolves through an [`OperandSource`], not the bare
//! store, so a prepared image is "the **effective** operands for this
//! source" — base representation plus whatever overlay it carries.
//! That keeps the two seams orthogonal and in the right order:
//!
//! ```text
//! base representation + overlay → OperandSource → PreparedOperands → executor
//! ```
//!
//! An image is therefore immutable *for the source it was prepared
//! from*: a session composing new edits prepares its own view rather
//! than mutating the shared one, so one image can serve every
//! concurrent request that shares its overlay.
//!
//! # Slicing
//!
//! Preparation takes an [`ExecutionSlice`] because a VINDEX3 component
//! is not only ever executed whole. A shard that owns layers 10–19, an
//! attention-only node, or an expert server all want *part* of the same
//! plan prepared, and none of them should pay for operands they will
//! never execute. `Full` is the common case; the variants below are the
//! seam the decoupled surfaces grow from, and preparation refuses a
//! slice the plan cannot satisfy rather than silently preparing less.
