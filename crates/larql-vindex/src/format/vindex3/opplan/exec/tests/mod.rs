//! Stage A gates (V3-G5b-2): the plan executor against the
//! checkpoint-driven production forward — layer by layer.
//!
//! The two sides share **nothing but the fixture's weight values**: the
//! oracle loads the HF checkpoint through `larql-models` and runs
//! `larql-compute`'s production layers (BLAS, hooks); the executor reads
//! the encoded container through the closure-verified operand path and
//! computes with its own naive loops. Agreement is therefore a claim
//! about *semantics* — plan interpretation, operand binding, norm
//! placement, RoPE convention, residual order — not shared arithmetic.
