//! QW-1 refusal integrity: a plan containing Gated DeltaNet layers is
//! refused BEFORE any layer output is committed.
//!
//! The "before" is the whole point. An error raised after some layers had
//! already executed would still be architecturally wrong: it would prove
//! the runtime can partially realise a model whose semantics it cannot
//! complete, and a caller holding those planes has no way to know they
//! describe 16 of 64 layers rather than the model.
//!
//! This becomes load-bearing the moment the builder emits real
//! `GatedDelta` layers, which it now does for `linear_attention` layers.
//! Qwen3.8-27B is 48 of 64 such layers, so "run the softmax ones" is not
//! a degraded mode — it is a different model.
