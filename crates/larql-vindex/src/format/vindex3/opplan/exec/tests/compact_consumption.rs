//! CPU-2A/2: the compact bytes reach the kernel STILL COMPACT.
//!
//! The failure this file exists to catch is the one that looks like
//! success from every other angle: a loader that keeps bf16, a census that
//! reports half the bytes, and a consumption path that widens a scratch

//! unchanged, and nothing else in the suite would notice.
//!
//! So these assert on what the executor RAN, not on what the loader
