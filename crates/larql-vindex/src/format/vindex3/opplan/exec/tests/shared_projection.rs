//! CPU-2C: one physical projection, two consumers, computed once.
//!
//! Qwen3.8's output gate is the other half of its query projection over
//! the same activation, and the backend projected `12288 x 5120` twice
//! per softmax layer to collect the halves separately — 2.01 GB/token of
//! traffic and 2.01 GB of residency for a vector it had already computed
//! and thrown away.
//!
//! The sharing is licensed by the JUDGED gate source, not by the two
//! operands happening to resolve to the same tensor. So the controls here
//! are about when it applies and when it must not:
//!
//! ```text
//! same operand + same activation   ->  one projection   (FusedQueryProjection)
//! its own operand                  ->  two projections  (AttentionInput)
//! sharing withheld                 ->  two projections, still correct
//! ```
//!
//! The last one matters most: the fallback has to stay right, because the
//! reference backend deliberately never shares — it is the literal
//! transcription, and "the two agree" is the whole reason this
//! optimisation is allowed.
