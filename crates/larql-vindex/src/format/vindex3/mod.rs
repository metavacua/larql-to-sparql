//! The VINDEX3 container — writing one, and opening one.
//!
//! # Why this module had to exist before "VINDEX3 works" could be said
//!
//! The VINDEX3 execution runtime ([`crate::runtime`]) was validated to
//! bit-identity against the shipped path, repeatedly and on a real 26B model.
//! But every one of those runs sourced its operands from a **VINDEX2** file:
//! `index.json.version` was 2 at every step. Nothing could write a VINDEX3
//! container, so `ContainerGeneration::V3` appeared in exactly one test,
//! constructed from a hand-written JSON string.
//!
//! That made the honest claim narrower than it sounded:
//!
//! ```text
//! proven      the VINDEX3 runtime, fed VINDEX2 operands, matches production
//! not proven  a VINDEX3 container can be written, opened, bound and executed
//! ```
//!
//! This module closes the second line for the control fixture. The middle of
//! the stack — LYRW v2 tables, the programme manifest, capability and
//! authority, the bound executor — was already built; what was missing was the
//! two ends, and an end that nothing exercises is an end nobody has debugged.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! <root>/
//! ├── index.json           schema 3 — sole root authority (§12)
//! ├── moe_manifest.json    programme description (§8)
//! └── routed/layer_000.lyrw  LYRW v2 bank (§6)
//! ```
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! No transcoding. A container assembler that also converted formats would be
//! the silent conversion §9.1 forbids, buried one layer below where anyone
//! would look for it. Regions are placed exactly as their producer wrote them.
