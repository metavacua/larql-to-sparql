//! One-checkpoint encode: the pipeline both extraction surfaces share.
//!
//! Migration rung M2: `larql extract --generation v3` and LQL
//! `EXTRACT ... FORMAT VINDEX3` must produce a container the same way
//! `larql vindex3 encode` does — so the whole pipeline lives here, once:
//!
//! ```text
//! checkpoint dir (config.json + *.safetensors)
//!   → build_inventory          interpretation, once
//!   → plan_system              admissibility, with the blocking
//!                              findings RENDERED into the refusal
//!                              (encode_system's own gate discards them)
//!   → encode_system            segments + system_graph + index
//!   → capability snapshot      tokenizer.json + the HF metadata set
//! ```
//!
//! The capability snapshot exists because the encoder proper writes only
//! what execution needs — segments, graph, index — while binding with
//! full capability (INFER, chat templates) needs the checkpoint's
//! tokenizer artifacts placed beside them. The V2 extractor has always
//! done this; a V3 container produced by an extraction surface must not
//! silently degrade to token-id-only capability.
