//! Representation compilation: add a compiled physical encoding of an
//! object to a container, without changing what the model *is*.
//!
//! ```text
//! source tensors → representation compiler → persisted representation pack
//!                                                      ↓
//!                                          a profile selects the pack
//! ```
//!
//! This is a third verb alongside the two that already exist, and the
//! distinction is the point:
//!
//! - **COMPILE** materialises overlay *meaning* into rewritten segments.
//! - **COMPACT** reorganises bytes while preserving meaning exactly
//!   (`SemanticDiff(input, output) == ∅`).
//! - **REPRESENT** adds a *lossy alternative encoding* beside the
//!   canonical bytes. It preserves neither byte-equality (the pack is new
//!   bytes) nor exact semantics (4-bit is an approximation), so it cannot
//!   hide behind either gate and carries its own: the compiled bytes must
//!   equal, bit for bit, what the runtime would have produced by
//!   quantising at load.
//!
//! That gate is what makes the operation safe, and it is met by
//! construction rather than by comparison: the compiler runs the *same two
//! steps* the load path runs — [`OperandSource::load`] then
//! [`quantize_nvfp4`] — so persisted and transient bytes cannot diverge
//! without one of those two changing for both.
//!
//! ## What it is for
//!
//! A 30B BF16 source is tens of gigabytes on disk and pays the
//! quantisation cost on every cold load. Neither is a property of the
//! model; both are properties of having only one stored representation.
//! Compiling one changes the artifact, not the semantics — and at K3
//! scale, where sparse expert fetches make bytes-per-expert an input to
//! the inference algorithm rather than a storage detail, it stops being a
//! convenience.
//!
//! ## What it does not do
//!
//! It does not replace the canonical representation. The source bytes stay
//! in the container and stay canonical; the compiled pack is added beside
//! them with [`Fidelity::Approximate`]. A profile then selects between
//! representations that *exist* — the rule
//! [`super::variants`] already states, and the reason a compiler is needed
//! at all: a profile cannot turn one encoding's bytes into another's.
