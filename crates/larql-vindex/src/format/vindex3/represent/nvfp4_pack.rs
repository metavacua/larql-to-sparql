//! The on-disk layout of a compiled NVFP4 tensor.
//!
//! A VINDEX3 segment describes a tensor by `dtype` + `shape`, and every
//! reader derives the byte layout from those two facts alone. This module is
//! that derivation for [`DTYPE_NVFP4`], so a compiled pack needs no runtime
//! inference — and no architecture registry — to be understood.
//!
//! ## Layout
//!
//! For `shape = [rows, k]` with `groups = k / 16`, one tensor's payload is
//! three contiguous regions:
//!
//! ```text
//! offset                              bytes                    meaning
//! 0                                   rows * groups * 8        E2M1 codes, lo nibble first
//! rows * groups * 8                   rows * groups            E4M3 group scales
//! rows * groups * 9                   4                        f32 tensor scale, LE
//! ```
//!
//! which is exactly [`larql_models::quant::nvfp4::stored_bytes`]. The two
//! scale levels and the element grid are NVFP4's, unchanged — see that
//! module for why both levels exist. Nothing here reinterprets them; this is
//! only where each region sits in a file.
//!
//! ## Why one table row, not three
//!
//! Codes, group scales and the tensor scale could each have been a segment
//! tensor. They are one row because they are one operand: the table would
//! otherwise carry three entries that must be kept consistent by a naming
//! convention, and a reader that resolved two of the three would produce
//! plausible garbage rather than an error. One row, one `len`, one offset —
//! and the split is arithmetic from `shape`.
