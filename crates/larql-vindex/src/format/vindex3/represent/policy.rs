//! Which tensors a representation applies to, by **role**.
//!
//! The obvious policy — "it is a 2-D matrix, so quantise it" — is not a
//! policy, it is a shape test. It happens to produce a good number on a
//! dense model and it silently 4-bits the embedding table and the output
//! head, which are among the places you would least want to be first.
//!
//! Eligibility is therefore semantic: a tensor's role decides, and the
//! default is conservative at every role where 4-bit is known to be
//! delicate. Explicit opt-in makes it more aggressive; nothing makes it
//! more aggressive by accident.
//!
//! ```text
//! decoder linear weights   REPRESENT   attention q/k/v/o, mlp gate/up/down
//! expert weights           REPRESENT   the prize at MoE scale
//!
//! embedding                PRESERVE
//! output head              PRESERVE
//! vision / audio / drafter PRESERVE    a whole component, not a tensor
//! norms                    PRESERVE
//! router / gate            PRESERVE    tiny, and routing errors compound
//! small vectors, biases    PRESERVE
//! anything unrecognised    PRESERVE    fail safe, never fail small
//! ```
//!
//! The last line is the one that matters most. A tensor this classifier
