//! Representation variants — a region set carries bytes, a profile picks which
//! (spec §9.1).
//!
//! # The one legal representation model
//!
//! A profile saying `"format": "mxfp4"` cannot turn Q6_K bytes into MXFP4 bytes
//! by declaration. Exactly one model is legal: **a region set may carry several
//! physically present variants, and a profile selects a present one.** There is
//! no runtime conversion anywhere in this module, and that is the point — "the
//! bytes executed are the bytes stored" (§10) holds by construction rather than
//! by discipline.
//!
//! # Why the refusal is the interesting part
//!
//! Selecting a variant that was never extracted is the failure this type
//! exists to make loud. It has to fail **closed**, and it has to fail naming
//! three things: the region set, the variant that was asked for, and the
//! variants actually present. A bare "variant not found" sends someone to
//! re-extract a terabyte before discovering that the pack they wanted is
//! spelled `native-mxfp4` and they asked for `mxfp4`.
//!
//! It also has to fail **before any byte is read**. A container whose profile
//! selects an absent variant is unservable, and finding that out during a bind
//! — after the segment files are resident — turns a naming error into a
//! partially-initialised load.
