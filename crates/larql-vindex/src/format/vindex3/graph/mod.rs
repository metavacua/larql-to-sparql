//! The VINDEX3 system graph — components, logical objects, representations,
//! and cross-component interface edges (V3-G2).
//!
//! A modern release is not a weights file; it is a *system*: a target model,
//! a perception tower physically embedded in the same checkpoint, a drafter
//! artifact consuming the target's hidden states through a declared tap
//! interface. The graph is the schema level where that structure lives:
//!
//! ```text
//!               SystemGraph
//!                    │
//!       ┌────────────┴────────────┐
//!       │                         │
//!  Component (role, topology)  HiddenStateEdge
//!       │                         (logical flow)
//!  LogicalObject  ←────────────── implemented by tensors,
//!       │                         but the edge is NOT the tensor
//!  Representation
//!       │
//!  SourceBinding (physical tensor names — never the identity)
//! ```
//!
//! Two identity rules are load-bearing:
//!
//! - **Object identity is conceptual.** `draft.target_feature_projector`,
//!   not `encoder.fc`. Physical tensor names live in [`SourceBinding`]s so
//!   the same logical operand can later carry several materialisations
//!   (bf16, q4, transposed-Metal) without unwinding its id.
//! - **The edge is not the implementing tensor.** A drafter's tap interface
//!   is logical flow between components; the fusion projector that
//!   implements its consumer side is a tensor object. The graph carries
//!   both, separately, linked by id.

/// Current system-graph schema. Bump on any breaking change.
///
/// v2: [`Component`] carries an [`ExecutionSurface`] (V3-G5a) — the
/// deletion invariant's missing half. A v1 graph deserialises with
/// `execution: None`, which [`execution_completeness`] reports as
/// incomplete.
///
/// v3: the execution surface distinguishes an *absent* operation from one
/// declared as the identity, and records the post-norm epsilon as a
/// judgment ([`larql_models::config::PostNormEps`]) rather than a bare
/// number. A v2 graph cannot be reinterpreted into v3: it wrote
/// `post_norm_eps` unconditionally, so a recorded value equal to
/// `norm_eps` is ambiguous between "declared distinct" and "shares" —
/// exactly the distinction v3 exists to keep. Such containers are
/// refused and must be re-encoded, never silently upgraded.
///
/// v4: the execution surface carries the judged *embedding
/// normalisation* ([`larql_models::config::EmbeddingNorm`]). A v3 graph
/// deserialises with `embedding_norm: None`, which under absence ≠
/// identity is the definite claim "this model has no such operation" —
/// wrong for any family that does, and silent because the norm is
/// weightless and no operand contradicts it. Refuse and re-encode.
///
/// v5: the norm surface carries a complete
/// [`larql_models::config::NormSpec`] per *site* (pre, post, final)
/// instead of a model-scope kind/epsilon/offset. Muse-Glimmer proved
/// twice that norm facts are per-site: its post-norms use a different
/// epsilon (1e-8 vs 1e-5) and its final norm a different weight offset
/// (0.0 vs 1.0, centred layers vs an ordinary final norm). A v4 graph
/// records one offset for every site, which is simply wrong for any
/// such family and unrecoverable from the graph alone.
