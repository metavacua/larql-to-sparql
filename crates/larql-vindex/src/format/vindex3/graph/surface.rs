//! The execution surface: what generic operations need in order to
//! execute a component (V3-G5a).
//!
//! [`super::Component`] answers *what part of the system this is*; the
//! surface answers *what the generic ops need to run it*. Fields are
//! grouped **by operation**, because the completeness contract derives
//! from the operations a component's objects imply — never from what any
//! particular architecture happens to declare:
//!
//! ```text
//! DecoderStack / PerceptionTower object  →  attention, ffn, norm
//! Embedding / OutputHead object          →  head
//! ```
//!
//! Every value is **fully resolved**: defaulting decisions (an absent
//! `hidden_act`, a post-norm epsilon shared with `norm_eps`, canonical
//! 1/√d attention scaling) are applied at build/judgment time and
//! persisted. A generic executor reads these fields; it never defaults an
//! absent one — absence is a completeness defect that refuses encoding,
//! not a branch at run time.
