//! `larql vindex3 verify` — prove source ≡ encoded (V3-G4, spec §7).
//!
//! Four explicit authorities, compared structurally and semantically:
//!
//! | Authority | Source |
//! |---|---|
//! | **Declared** | what HF said (`config.json`, shard headers) |
//! | **Resolved** | what LARQL interpreted (detection + policies) |
//! | **Graph** | the logical system constructed at G2, rebuilt now |
//! | **Encoded** | what the container actually contains |
//!
//! The invariant is `Declared ≡ Resolved ≡ Graph ≡ Encoded` for everything
//! execution-semantic, checked as three pairwise links — a failure names the
//! two authorities that disagree, which is the diagnosis.
//!
//! Two equivalence claims are kept **separate**, because each can fail while
//! the other holds:
//!
//! - **semantic equivalence** — the pairwise authority chain above;
//! - **byte payload equivalence** — per representation, the source payload
//!   hash (recomputed from the checkpoint *now*, in segment order), the
//!   encoded payload-region hash (recomputed from the container *now*) and
//!   the hash the directory recorded at encode time must all agree. Both
//!   ends are re-read, so a checkpoint that drifted after encoding fails
//!   exactly like a container that was corrupted after encoding — with a
//!   detail saying which end moved.
//!
//! "Tensor count before == after" is not verification and does not appear
//! here; the tensor *table* (names, dtypes, shapes, offsets) is compared
//! entry by entry instead, because a relabelled dtype or shape over
//! identical bytes is invisible to every hash in the container.
