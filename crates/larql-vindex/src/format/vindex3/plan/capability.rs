//! Execution admissibility, scoped to what a request actually needs.
//!
//! Today's plan answers one question — *is every declared semantic fact of
//! this checkpoint representable?* — and reports it as a single Boolean.
//! That is the right question for **model completeness**, and this module
//! does not weaken it: [`SystemPlan::admissible`] still means
//! `blocking == 0` over the whole system.
//!
//! It is the wrong question for **execution**. A checkpoint is not one
//! program. Qwen3.8-27B carries a vision tower whose execution surface
//! this build cannot resolve, and 12 of its 30 blocking findings are that
//! tower — so ordinary text generation, which never reaches a vision
//! weight, is refused for a reason that cannot affect it. Meanwhile
//! Gemma 4 26B-A4B reports `admissible: true` while shipping **zero**
//! audio tensors against a declared `audio_config` and `audio_token_id`:
//! the Boolean says yes to a capability the container cannot perform.
//!
//! Both failures are the same failure. Representability is a property of
//! the *model*; admissibility is a property of a *capability over* that
//! model. This module adds the second without touching the first.
//!
//! # Membership is semantic, not ownership
//!
//! The tempting implementation is `finding.component == "vision"`. It is
//! wrong, and this checkpoint says so out loud: `vision_start_token_id`
//! and `vision_end_token_id` (Qwen3.8), and `image_token_id` / `boi_token_id`
//! / `eoi_token_id` and the `audio_*` family (Gemma 4), all live at
//! `component: "root"`. They are not the tower. They are the **binding
//! edge** — how an image enters the token stream — and text generation
//! must not depend on them while image-conditioned generation must.
//! A component filter passes that case while being wrong about it, which
//! is why membership is decided on the subject's own semantics here.
//!
//! # Fail closed
//!
//! An unclassified subject is required by **every** capability. A new
//! config key, a new tensor group, a spelling this build has never seen —
//! all block everything until something claims them. The opposite default
//! would let an unrecognised blocker quietly exempt itself from the
//! capability that actually needs it, which is the exact shape of the
//! `layer_types` bug: parsed, never consulted, silently fine.
