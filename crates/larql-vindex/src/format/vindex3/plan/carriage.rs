//! How far a declared fact travels — the VINDEX3-boundary authority gate.

//! The inventory answers *did a parser read this key?*
//! ([`KeyStatus::Consumed`](larql_models::inventory::KeyStatus::Consumed)).
//! The plan used to treat that answer as *can VINDEX3 represent this

//! between them is silent by construction: a fact the parser reads into
//! `ModelConfig` and VINDEX3 then drops looks fully covered from the
//! plan's side.
//!
//! GPT-OSS is the witness. It declares `rope_scaling = {rope_type:

//! classifies `consumed` — the parser genuinely reads them. But
//! [`PositionPolicy`] expresses `Rope { theta } | None` and nothing
//! else, and no other field under `format/vindex3/` carries a scaling
//! block, so the model would plan, encode and execute as **plain rope at
//! θ=150000**, with the plan reporting no defect at all. (VINDEX1/2 do
//! carry it, as raw JSON — so this is a regression the older path does
//! not have.)
//!

//! config.json fact
//!    ↓  parsed        larql-models' parser stored it in ModelConfig

//!
//! Each execution-semantic key needs a [`CarriageRule`] declaring which
//! of those stages it reaches. Rules claiming [`Carriage::Represented`]
//! or deeper carry a **probe** that reads the value back off the built
//! graph, so the claim is checked against the schema rather than
//! trusted; a probe that disagrees with the declaration blocks. Rules
//! that honestly stop at [`Carriage::Parsed`] must say why, and are
//! reported rather than hidden. A key with **no rule at all** blocks —
