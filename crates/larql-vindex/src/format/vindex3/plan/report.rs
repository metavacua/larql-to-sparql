//! Output types for the semantic representability plan (`larql vindex3 plan`).
//!
//! A plan is a statement over one or more inspected artifacts of **exactly
//! why** the current VINDEX3 container schema can or cannot faithfully encode
//! them. Findings are typed twice:
//!
//! - **category** — what kind of statement this is: representable,
//!   value-mismatched between authorities, unrepresented, or a declared
//!   cross-component interface.
//! - **semantic class** — how much losing it would matter. `consumed` in the
//!   inventory is *not* sufficient: a key can be consumed and still resolve
//!   to a different value than the checkpoint declared, which is why
//!   mismatch findings compare values, not statuses.
//!
//! The verdict is fail-closed: any mismatched/unrepresented finding whose
//! class is execution-, tensor-, or interface-semantic — or whose key the
//! registry has never seen (`unknown`) — makes the plan inadmissible.
