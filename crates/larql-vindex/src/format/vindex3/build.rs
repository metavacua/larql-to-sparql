//! Stream a many-layer VINDEX3 container to disk (container ladder c9).
//!
//! # Why c9 is not just c8 in a loop
//!
//! [`super::write::write_container`] takes a [`ContainerSpec`] whose segments
//! own their bytes. That is the right shape for one fixture-sized bank and the
//! wrong shape for a model: layer 0 of `gemma4-26b-a4b` is ~421 MB, so
//! describing thirty of them the c8 way would hold ~12 GB of already-mapped
//! weights a second time, in RAM, purely to hand them to a writer that puts
//! them straight back on disk.
//!
//! This builder inverts that. Each layer is written **directly at its final
//! path** as it arrives, and only the manifest entries — a few hundred bytes
//! per layer — accumulate:
//!
//! ```text
//! c8   describe all layers -> hold all bytes -> write everything
//! c9   describe one layer  -> write it       -> forget it -> next
//! ```
//!
//! Peak memory is therefore one expert's slice, whatever the model's size.
//!
//! # The write order is the crash contract
//!
//! Segments, then the manifest, then `index.json` **last** — the same ordering
//! [`super::write::write_container`] states, and for the same reason.
//! `index.json` is the discriminator every reader dispatches on, so a crash
//! part-way through a thirty-layer import must leave a directory that is *not
//! yet* a VINDEX3 container, rather than one that announces itself as VINDEX3
//! and is missing two thirds of its banks. That distinction matters more here
//! than at c8, because a multi-gigabyte import is long enough to actually be
//! interrupted.
//!
//! # Still verbatim
//!
//! Nothing here transcodes, requantises or repacks. The builder places bytes
//! and declares them, exactly as §9.1 requires of the one-layer path — a
//! streaming assembler that also converted formats would hide the silent
//! conversion one level below where c8 already forbids it.
