//! Container generation detection and dispatch (format spec §12.1).
//!
//! One larql binary supports both vindex generations, indefinitely, for reading
//! and serving. `index.json`'s `version` field is the **sole** discriminator —
//! no filename sniffing, no directory-shape heuristics:
//!
//! | `index.json.version` | generation | layer format |
//! | -------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
//! | 1                    | VINDEX2    | LYRW `format_version` 1 |
//! | 2                    | VINDEX2    | LYRW `format_version` 1 |
//! | 3                    | VINDEX3    | LYRW `format_version` 2 |
//!
//! The generation is named for its *current* `index.json.version`. An earlier
//! draft called the shipped generation "VINDEX1" while its version was already
//! 2, which put a permanent off-by-one between the name and the discriminator
//! — the single most likely way to mis-detect a directory. Both were renamed
//! so the two agree.
//!
//! **The mapping is not a bijection below 2.** `index.json.version` 1 is a
//! *legacy schema of the same shipped generation*, not a pre-generation
//! artifact: such indexes exist in the wild and the loader reads them by
//! filling absent fields with defaults. Refusing them would break VINDEX2
//! compatibility, which is the one thing dual-generation support exists to
//! protect. This was caught by the E0 preservation matrix, which is why that
//! matrix runs on every commit.
//!
//! The layer format keeps its own sequence and is deliberately *not* aligned to
//! either: LYRW is a different artifact with a different lifetime, and its own
//! numbering was already correct. A VINDEX3 container holds LYRW v2 files.
//!
//! Detection fails closed. An unknown version names the version found and the
//! versions this binary supports, before any weight byte is read — a loader
//! that guesses produces a served model with wrong weights, not an error.
