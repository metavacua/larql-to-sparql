//! `GET /v1/sessions`, `GET /v1/sessions/{id}`, `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}`
//! — the operational view and eviction control plane for runtime session
//! state.
//!
//! # What this surface is, and is not
//!
//! It **observes and terminates** state the runtime already owns. It is
//! deliberately *not* a second authority for modifying model state: there
//! is no create, no rename, no patch editing here. Patches are applied
//! and removed through `/v1/patches` (and LQL); this endpoint reports
//! their identities and can free the whole session. Keeping mutation in
//! one place is what stops the session API and the patch algebra from
//! drifting into two different answers about what a session contains.
//!
//! For the same reason the representation is metadata only — patch names
//! and counts, continuation *availability* and token counts — never
//! overlay contents, KV bytes, tokenizer state, or cache keys.
//!
//! # Deletion
//!
//! `DELETE` is idempotent and strong. It frees the patch overlay, frees
//! every KV continuation the session owns, and retires the session's
//! lease so a generation still in flight cannot re-insert one afterwards.
//! Repeat deletes are not an error: they report `deleted: false` and free
//! nothing. Unrelated sessions are untouched.
//!
//! A delete that lands while a sessioned request is mid-forward-pass
//! waits for that request's read guard and then removes the session; the
//! in-flight request completes safely on the state it already acquired.
//! That is the frozen contract — see the tests in
//! `tests/test_http_sessions.rs`.
