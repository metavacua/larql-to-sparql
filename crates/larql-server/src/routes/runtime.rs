//! `GET /v1/runtime` — server + model + backend + memory + performance
//! snapshot. The canonical introspection surface for a LARQL client
//! that isn't the CLI: a desktop menu-bar app, a status dashboard, or
//! `curl` during development.
//!
//! Deliberately distinct from the two existing introspection routes:
//!
//! - `/v1/models` says what models *exist* (OpenAI-compatible listing).
//! - `/v1/stats` says what one *bound vindex* looks like (features,
//!   layers, quant caches) — 404s when no model is loaded.
//! - `/v1/runtime` says what this LARQL *process* is doing right now:
//!   is it up, how long has it been up, what (if anything) is
//!   currently generating, and how fast the last request ran.
//!   `model` is `null` rather than a 404 when no model is bound (zero
//!   models, or an ambiguous multi-model server) — the process facts
//!   are still worth reporting even when the model facts aren't.
//!
//! Every `performance` field is a snapshot of a real measurement taken
//! at the generation call site ([`crate::runtime_stats`]) — this
//! handler never recomputes a rate itself, so `/v1/runtime` cannot
//! silently drift from what a client actually experienced.
//!
//! Read-only by design (first slice): no load/unload, and no
//! `/v1/{model_id}/runtime` multi-model variant yet — `performance`
//! and `generation` are server-wide, not per-model, so a per-id
//! variant would only change the `model` block. Follow-up if that
//! turns out to matter once multi-model serving has real users of
//! this endpoint.
