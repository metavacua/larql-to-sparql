//! N1 — KV continuation cache for the Responses API (V3 runtimes).
//!
//! A stored response's conversation can be continued via
//! `previous_response_id`. Without this cache every chained turn
//! re-prefills the whole conversation; with it the producing turn's
//! [`V3KvHandoff`] stays resident, keyed by response id, and the next
//! link continues from it — the resumed positions cost nothing.
//!
//! Contract notes:
//!
//! - **Purely an optimisation.** The generation path
//!   ([`crate::vindex3::generate_v3_resumable`]) only reuses a handoff
//!   whose absorbed ids are a strict prefix of the new prompt; any
//!   mismatch falls back to a full prefill. Losing an entry (eviction,
//!   TTL, restart, branching) can never change produced tokens.
//! - **Take-once.** A chained request *takes* the entry (KV states are
//!   large; sharing one across concurrent chains would need cloning).
//!   Branching two continuations off one response gives the second
//!   branch a full prefill — correct, just not accelerated.
//! - **Tightly bounded.** KV states are the biggest per-conversation
//!   objects the server holds, so the cap is small and the TTL short
//!   compared to the session map; both are CLI-tunable and the
//!   maintenance sweeper drives the TTL.
//! - **Session-owned when the client asks.** A request carrying an
//!   `X-Session-Id` binds a [`crate::session`] session, and the state it
//!   retains is owned by it. That ownership is what lets
//!   `DELETE /v1/sessions/{id}` free continuations, and what lets a late
//!   insert from a generation still in flight be refused instead of
//!   resurrecting a deleted session. Requests without the header retain
//!   unowned states, governed by capacity and TTL alone.
