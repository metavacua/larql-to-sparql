//! VI3-SERVE-1: a VINDEX3 container served over the normal API.
//!
//! One vertical slice, deliberately boring:
//!
//! ```text
//! VINDEX3 container → Vindex3Runtime → CanonicalKvState
//!     → prefill_into() → session_with_kv() → continue_session()
//!     → existing SSE/JSON shaping
//! ```
//!
//! What deliberately does **not** happen here: no `load_vindex3() ->
//! ModelWeights`, no `VectorIndex`, no `ModelArchitecture` — a V3
//! container binds as an executable program and is served through the
//! runtime stack INF-0..3 and KV-1 gated bit-for-bit. The V2/V3
//! distinction is decided once, at model binding
//! ([`crate::bootstrap::load_artifact`] /
//! [`crate::state::AppState::served`]); generation code below the
//! binding never asks which format it is running.
//!
//! Operand residency: the container's operands are lowered into the
//! backend's execution form **once, at bind time**
//! ([`Vindex3Runtime::prepare`]), and every request reads that one
//! image. Before that, batch prefill and the decode session each
//! materialised the whole model for themselves — 3.8 s + 3.3 s against
//! 0.13 s of actual decode on a 3 B container, i.e. ~94% of a warm
//! request spent loading a model the server already had.
