//! Vindex Factory driver — recipe schema, `build_id` canonicaliser, and
//! structural validator. See `docs/vindex-factory.md` §3.1: this crate
//! is the single implementation both the GitHub Action and the rig
//! worker call (as `larql recipe validate` / `larql recipe build-id`),
//! so there's nothing to keep in sync between them.
//!
//! Scope: §4's recipe schema, §5's `build_id`, the structural half of
//! §6.1's PR-check gate, §6.1 step 4's size/cost estimator, §9's card
//! generator, and §7's PREFLIGHT→RELEASE build driver (`run_build`) —
//! MIRROR and REGISTER are external-harness concerns, and VERIFY here
//! is checksum integrity only; see `build`'s module doc for why.
